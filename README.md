Hospital Management System is a Project that was made for **(Computer Language-2 - Second Year)** in my college. It is a Project for dealing with Java FXML and SQL Database. I have used the basic concepts of OOP. I have also used MVC design pattern. 

There are two users: System Admin and Doctor. System Admin can view Patients information records, and Doctors information records. He also can enter new Doctor, or search for one by Name. Doctor can view Patients information records and their appointments. He can also add new appointment, or search for one by Patient name or Doctor name.
